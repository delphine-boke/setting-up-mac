after installing [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java20) of your choice, you can set a default one, when having more than two java versions, obviously.!

go to your .zshrc on your terminal by command+shift+. the dot is a period to show hidden files. 

now open with VS Code IDE or whatever IDE you use. scroll to the bottom and add this:

``export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk<version>.jdk/Contents/Home``

where <version> is the number of the jdk installed on your machine.

e.g, for me i used:

``export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home``

make sure to save the file by command+S.

to check whether that's the version you required, run:

``java --version``
