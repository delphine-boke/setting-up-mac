setting up your mac for use for first time:

- install browsers
   > brave, chrome, opera mini, ms edge, firefox
   
- download manager
 > https://www.freedownloadmanager.org
 
- install brew:
  zsh: command not found: brew error
  do this:
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  
  then
  you can echo the command to add this to path:
  echo "export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
  
  then 
  brew doctor
  to repair brew if needed.
  
 
 run brew -v to see the version of homebrew installed. 
 mine is homebrew 4.0.23
 
- install oh my zsh by running the command:
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
  
  to set up a theme, do this:
  open your terminal and run:
   ~/.zshrc
   
   or command+shift+. to show hidden files.
   . means a period. (you can do the same command to not list the hidden files after you're done).
   
   you then open the .zshrc file and edit your theme according to: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
   
   e.g ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell" which is the default.
  
  
 
- create a new github ssh key:
  https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
  
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   
   secure a passphrase
   then add $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" to an agent
   
   
   to test your ssh connection, run:
   $ ssh -T git@github.com
   
   add that ssh key to github and you're set.!
