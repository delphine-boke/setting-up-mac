to set up a virtual environ, you can do by using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and having the command:

``conda activate``
on a new project and giving it a name.

you may also use ``pipenv`` command.

my favorite is command+shift+P on VS Code. you then type out:

``create a new python environment``

choose the interpreter (enabled globally or not) then you begin your project. remember, this also comes with diff pip versions.
